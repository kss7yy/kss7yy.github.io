Welcome to the repository holding the contents of my personal website: www.kunaalsarnaik.com. Following several YouTube tutorial videos, I created this website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Essentially, the website contains more information about me, including my education, experiences, and projects! I will also be periodically blogging on a specific page of the website, so stay tuned!
